This repository contains a modified version of AmpliDiff (https://github.com/JaspervB-tud/AmpliDiff) for CSE 3000 Research Project at the TU Delft.
This version was modified to allow AmpliDiff to run on segmented genomes, by pasting them together using the '8' character.
It also contains the accession id's for the datasets used under the datasets folder.

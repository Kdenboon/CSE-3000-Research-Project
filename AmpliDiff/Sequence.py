        '''
        Function that determines the number of "nucleotides" that have to preceed (exceed) such that there are at exactly $min_non_align nucleotides before (after) it. This requires
        the existence of the aligned_to_trim list in the Sequence object in order to work.
        
        As an example consider the sequence --ac-t-gtacctg-a-gc- ([-1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12]) and min_non_align=3.
        Since we want at least 3 non-align characters, we should find the first index in the aligned_to_trim list equal to 3 as before this index there are exactly 3 non-align characters.
        Similarly, there is a total of 13 non-align chars, and we thus need the index of the 13-3=10th non-align such that everything afterwards contains exactly 3 non-align characters.
        It should be noted that there may be some ambiguity in this because as in the example there are two elements equal to 10. The goal is to find lb and ub such that:
            self.sequence[:lb] and self.sequence[ub:] both contain exactly &min_non_align non-align characters and,
            moving lb one to the left, or ub one to the right no longer satisfies the previous property

        Parameters
        ----------
        min_non_align : int
            Number of non-alignment characters before and after the bounds to be found.

        Returns
        -------
        lb : int
            index such that there are exactly $min_non_align non-alignment characters before it.
        ub : int
            index such that there are exactly $min_non_align non-alignment characters before it.
